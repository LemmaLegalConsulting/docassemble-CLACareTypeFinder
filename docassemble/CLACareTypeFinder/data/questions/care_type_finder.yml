  description: |
    If you know a minor in Massachusetts who needs temporary or permanent care, the Care Type Finder
    can help you decide the right type of support with a few easy to answer questions.

    Some kinds of support need a judge to make a decision. Others can be given by the parent without a judge.

    The Care Type Finder will help you decide between:

    * Guardianship
    * Temporary agent
    * Caregiver authorization

    And if you are the parent of the minor, the tool can also help you let the court know that you disagree
    with someone trying to become the guardian of your child or that you want a new guardian for your child.

    Answer a few questions about your family's situation to get suggestions for the correct type of support.
  can_I_use_this_form: |
    You can use this tool if you are a parent, grandparent, or other person who cares about a minor in Massachusetts.

    At the end of this tool, you will be given a link that can help you make
    the form that you need to take the action that you decide on.
  before_you_start: |
    This tool will help you think through the right option for the minor
    that you care about. You do not need to be ready to take an action when
    you finish using the tool.

  A court chooses an adult to be a Guardian. That person is

  Guardianship can last a few days or till a child turns 18. 
  The guardian can make the all decisions that a parent 
  would make.

  They cannot consent to adoption. The parents can limit the 
  power of the agent.

  A Temporary Agent can make decisions for up to 60 days. 
  The parents can appoint the same temporary agent multiple 
  times. Choosing a Temporary Agent does not require visiting 
  a court.

  They can only make decisions about medical care or 
  schooling. A parent can limit the power of the caregiver.

  A Caregiver can make decisions for up to two years. The 
  parents can appoint the same Caregiver multiple times.
